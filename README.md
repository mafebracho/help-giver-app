Once logged in you can either ask or give help. If you ask for help, you are redirected to a restricted route where you can see only your requests. You can *create* a new request, *update* or *delete* it. 
If you give help, you are sent to a landing page with all the requests, you can have a look at them by hovering over each one and, if interested, you can click on the "contact" button. Clicking the button, you can send an email to the person who asked for help.
